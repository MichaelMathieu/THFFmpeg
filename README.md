# THFFmpeg

Some (quick and not so dirty) bindings of ffmpeg for torch.
Big thanks to https://github.com/mpenkov/ffmpeg-tutorial for their tutorials.

## Install

Clone this git, then type
```
luarocks make
```

### Troubleshooting

When installing, I had a problem with the version of ffmpeg (the headers version didn't match the loaded library).
There is now a check at initialization. If it fails, make sure that you compile with the same headers.
A way to force them is
```
luarocks make
cd build
ccmake .
# set the correct paths
cd ..
luarocks make
```
After that, as long as you don't remove the `build` folder, it should compile fine with the future `luarocks make` calls.

The only way I found to set the correct paths were to add `-I/usr/include/ffmpeg` to the CXX and C flags, in `ccmake .`.
This should work on NYU servers, but other paths may be necessary depending on where you installed `ffmpeg`.

### Testing

To test the install, you can run
```
th test/test.th
```

## Usage

In torch:
```
require 'thffmpeg'

decoder = THFFmpeg() --creates a decoder object
decoder:open('myvideo.avi') --opens the video myvideo.avi
frame1 = decoder:next_frame() --allocates a new tensor and puts the first frame in it
frame2 = torch.Tensor(42,42)
decoder:next_frame(frame2) --resizes frame2 if necessary and puts the second frame in it
decoder:close() --closes the video
decoder:open('myvideo2.avi') --opens the video myvideo2.avi
```

Note that closing the video is not strictly necessary, are the decoder will automatically close
it when another video is opened, or when it is garbage collected.
